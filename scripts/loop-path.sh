# INFO: Picks the loop path of a change and prints one word: short or full.
#
#   short   every changed file is a .md, and none is CLAUDE.md or lives
#           under .claude/ or .github/
#   full    anything else, including a change with no files
#
# The changed files are the paths given as arguments or, with none, what
# differs from origin/main: the branch's commits, the working tree and the
# untracked files. A rename counts as both of its paths, so renaming a
# file out of CLAUDE.md, .claude/ or .github/ still forces the full loop.
# The files that force the full loop go to stderr.
